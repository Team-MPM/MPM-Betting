// This code defines a <Router> component that is used to render different
// pages in a Blazor application based on the current route.
//
// The Router component is configured with an AppAssembly, which is
// set to the assembly containing the Program class. This tells the
// router which assemblies to scan for routes.
//
// The Router component contains a <Found> element, which is used to
// render the component that matches the current route. The RouteView
// component is used to render the matched component, and it is
// configured with the current route data (routeData) and a default
// layout type (MainLayout).
//
// The <FocusOnNavigate> component is used to set the focus on an element
// within the rendered component. In this case, it is set to the first
// <h1> element within the rendered component.
